# SIMPLE Blackjack Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the Blackjack card game.

## Files

- `main.cpp`: The main program that runs the Blackjack game.
- `blackjack.h`: Header file containing the constants and the `Card` struct definition.
- `score.cpp`: Source file containing the implementation of the `calculateScore` function.
- `score.h`: Header file declaring the `calculateScore` function.
- `cards.cpp`: Source file containing the implementation of the `printCards` function.
- `cards.h`: Header file declaring the `Card` struct and the `printCards` function.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile the program, you can use a C++ compiler such as `g++`. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source files. Then, use the following command to compile:

```shell
g++ main.cpp score.cpp cards.cpp -o blackjack

This command will generate an executable file named blackjack in the current directory.

After compiling the program, you can run it by executing the generated executable. Use the following command:
./blackjack

The program will start running and prompt you for input to play the game.

Game Rules
The game follows the standard rules of Blackjack:

The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and the Ace can be worth 1 or 11.
The player is dealt two cards initially and can choose to hit (draw another card) or stand (stop drawing cards).
The dealer (computer) will also draw cards until their hand value reaches 17 or higher.
If the player's hand value exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.
If the dealer's hand value exceeds 21, they bust and the player wins the game.
If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the one with the higher hand value wins. A tie is also possible.
